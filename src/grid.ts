 * negative too — the table grows whichever way the player builds. Pure, like
 * every rule here: nothing is changed in place.
 *
 * As a string, for an answer and a kept game, the grid is drawn from its own
 * top-left tile: its rows in order, joined by "/", each row written as runs of
 * empty squares (a number) and tiles. English letters keep their short form;
 * other tiles are URI-escaped between `~` and `;`. `cat/2o/2w` is CAT across
 * and COW down from its C. Only
 * where the tiles stand beside one another is written, never where on the
 * table they were, so one grid has one spelling however far it was dragged.
