/**
 * A WILD LAID WITHOUT A LETTER READS AS WHATEVER MAKES THE GRID WORDS. John,
 * 2026-09-29, having laid D, a blank wild, O, N, E and been told "Not a word:
 * D*ONE": "Either we are smarter and use a regex or something to know that
 * it's a valid possible word." Choosing the wild's letter is still offered,
 * and a wild given one reads as that letter only; a blank one is any letter
 * the list allows.
 *
 * One blank can stand in two runs, across and down, and two blanks can share
 * a run, so the letters are chosen together: blank by blank, each letter
 * kept only while every run through it could still be a word — a run with
 * blanks left in it is asked whether any word of its length fits the letters
 * it has, a run with none whether it is one. Blanks that share no run are
 * settled apart, so one crossword's wilds never multiply another's.
 *
 * `readWilds` hands back the grid with each blank given the wild of a letter
 * that works (`wildFor`), or null where no choice makes every run a word —
 * and the grid is then judged as laid, blank and all, so the line under the
 * table names the run as the player spelled it. It gives up, answering null,
 * past `WILD_SEARCH_MOST` steps: a grid it could not settle is not called
 * sound.
