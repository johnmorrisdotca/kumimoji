/**
 * WHERE A WORD CAN CROSS A CROSSWORD WITHOUT SPOILING IT: the one rule the
 * generator lays its bags by (`generate.ts`) and the computer player lays its
 * own table by (`computerPlay.ts`), written once.
 *
 * A word laid across or down through a tile already down, with nothing at
 * either end of it and no new tile touching anything at its sides, makes one
 * new run — the word itself — and leaves every other run as it was. So on a
 * grid that was sound, the grid after it is sound too: that is what lets the
 * generator promise every bag can be finished, and what keeps the computer
 * from ever leaving a misspelt table.
 *
 * With DIAGONALS (`diagonalWord`), a new tile may also make or lengthen a
 * diagonal run of three or more (`DIAGONAL_RUN_LEAST`), which is then read
 * too; a word is laid only where each such run is a word, so a sound grid
 * stays sound under that rule as well.
 *
 * Pure, and blind to what the squares are kept in: the caller answers what
 * letter stands at a square (`""` for none) and whether a square may be used
 * at all, so the generator's fixed laying square and the computer's table
 * with no edges ask the same question.
