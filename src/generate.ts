/**
 * MAKING A KUMIMOJI, in the browser, from a seed: the bag the game is played
 * from, in the order its tiles come out.
 *
 * A bag drawn blind from the mix can be one nobody can finish — two Q's and
 * no U, and every tile must be laid before the game ends. So the bag is made
 * the other way round: a crossword is laid first, word by word, from letters
 * drawn from the mix (`TILE_MIX`), and the bag is that crossword's tiles,
 * shuffled. Every bag has at least one finished grid, which is the puzzle's
 * `solution` — kept only to prove that, never shown — and a player may build
 * any other.
 *
 * The crossword grows from a word across the middle: each next word crosses
 * a tile already down, its new tiles touching nothing at their sides, so every
 * run on it is a word by construction. Words are chosen to use the letters
 * drawn from the mix, and never a letter more times than the whole set holds,
 * so the bag reads like a handful from the full set.
 *
 * With Diagonals, the crossword must read as a word along its diagonals too:
 * a new tile that would make a diagonal run of three or more is laid only
 * where that run is a word (`fit`), so the proof holds under the rule the
 * game is played by. Without, nothing about the laying changes, and a seed
 * deals the bag it always dealt.
 *
 * Deterministic in the seed, like every generator here: two browsers in a
 * race, or one tomorrow, deal the same bag in the same order.
