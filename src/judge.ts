/**
 * A GRID JUDGED AGAINST ITS LANGUAGE'S LIST, the one way the solo game, each
 * seat of a pass-and-play game and the server's check all ask it: a run is a
 * word when its tiles spell one the list holds (`wordOf`, so a wild reads as
 * the letter or kana it was given), and a run that is not is named as it
 * reads. A wild given no letter reads as whichever letter makes every run
 * through it a word (`readWilds`); where none does, the grid is judged as
 * laid and the run is named with its `*`. `rules` says whether the diagonals
 * are read (`GridRules`).
