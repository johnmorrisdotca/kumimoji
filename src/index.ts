/**
 * Kumimoji 組み文字: the race to build a crossword from a bag of letter
 * tiles, in English or Japanese, alone or at a table of two to eight, as
 * plain functions over plain data.
 *
 * A game is dealt from a seed (`generateKumimoji`), so two players racing the
 * same bag get the same tiles in the same order. The tiles you hold and the
 * grid you build are values (`deal`, `placeFromHand`, `draw`, `trade` and the
 * rest), and every run across and down is judged against a word list
 * (`judgeWithWords`, `checkKumimoji`). A table of players shares one bag
 * (`startParty`, `endTurn`), and a computer player can sit at it
 * (`planComputerTurn`). Nothing here touches the DOM or a clock.
 *
 * The word lists are loaded when first needed: in a browser by
 * `loadTileWords`, which fetches them as their own modules; on a server or in
 * a test through `@johnmorrisdotca/kumimoji/words`, which reads them from
 * disk.
