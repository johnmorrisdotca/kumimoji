 * game and then it rotates."
 *
 * One bag for everybody, read as a line exactly as the solo game reads it
 * (`play.ts`), and a hand and a table for each player. A player's turn is
 * played with the solo game's own moves on a `TilePlay` made of the shared bag
 * and their own hand and table (`seatPlay`), and put back (`withSeatPlay`), so
 * laying, moving, swapping, sorting and trading are the one set of rules.
 * What is only the party's is here — the deal, whose turn it is, and Draw for
 * everybody — and in `partyTurns.ts`: Done, going out, the last round,
 * resigning and who won. Pure, like every rule here: each returns a new game.
