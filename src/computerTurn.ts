/**
 * A COMPUTER'S TURN in a pass-and-play game (John, 2026-09-28: "Also you can
 * add computer bots"), planned whole before any of it is shown: a list of
 * steps, each the game after one thing it did, the last one the game it
 * passes on. The page shows them one at a time with a short pause and keeps
 * only the last (`KumimojiPartyComputer`), so a reload in the middle plays
 * the same turn again from its start — the plan is pure and has no
 * randomness, so it is the same turn — and a reload after it finds it done.
 *
 * Its play, by the same rules as anybody's and through the same moves:
 *
 * - Lay the best word it can (`bestLaying`): its own tiles only, crossing
 *   what is down, the grid sound after every word.
 * - Draw whenever its hand is used and its grid sound, so everybody takes a
 *   tile, and play on.
 * - Trade its rarest tile when its hand lays nothing, once a turn at most,
 *   as anybody may (`mayTradeThisTurn`).
 * - Press Done — going out, when its hand is used and the bag cannot give
 *   everybody a tile — once it is done or has taken `COMPUTER_STEPS_MOST`
 *   steps, which keeps a turn to a few seconds to watch.
 * - Resign only where the rules offer it (`mayResign`) and it can do nothing
 *   at all: nothing to lay, nothing to trade for, and it is not its last turn.
