/**
 * A PASS-AND-PLAY GAME KEPT IN THE BROWSER, as one string of JSON: the
 * settings, the whole bag in its order, what was traded back and taken, whose
 * turn it is, who is out, who resigned and who still has a last turn, what
 * this turn has done so far, and every player's
 * name, hand and grid (`encodeGrid`), and whether a computer plays it. The
 * bag is written out rather than made again from the seed, so a game left half
 * way opens the same after the generator has changed.
 *
 * Joining, leaving and computer players came after the first version of this
 * and did not change its number: `dealt` and a player's `computer` are
 * written only when they say something, and a game kept without them reads
 * as one dealt to as many as sit at it, every seat a person's.
 *
 * It is never sent to the server: a local game has no points, no record and
 * nothing to check, and the names in it are the players' own business.
