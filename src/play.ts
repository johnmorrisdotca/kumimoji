 * A KUMIMOJI BEING PLAYED: the bag, the tiles traded back into it, how many
 * have been taken out, the tiles on the table and the hand. Every move is a
 * function that returns a new state and leaves the one it was given alone,
 * the way the engine's moves are. Nothing here knows how the table is being
 * looked at — zoom and pan are the view's (`tableView.ts`), never the game's.
 *
 * THE BAG IS A LINE, not a heap. Its tiles come out in the order the seed dealt
 * them (`givens`), and a tile traded back joins the END of the line, so the
 * tiles still to come are always `bag + returned` from `taken` on. That keeps
 * a game the same for everybody at a seed, trades and all, and lets a kept
 * game be checked: what is held — hand and table — is exactly what was taken,
 * less what was given back.
